 Files that you need to turn your android phone into your own amiibo music player.


If you're an amiibo collector, you may have seen the amiibo music players like [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGOuCgbN1nc) that allow you to turn your minatures into your very own music player collection. And if you're like me, you may have wanted to make one yourself...if the barrier of soldering and coding the thing wasn't there to stop you.

To all those people who felt the same, I have created this: The android amiibo music player. It runs using the [Automate app](https://llamalab.com/automate/) on android, using the "Amiibo ID List", and "Amiibo Music Player" flows (also by me) that you can download in the app.

The files here include instructions on how to set your phone up with automate to get your amiibo working, as well as some preselected music files to play (using my own collection as a basis).

Have fun!
