# amiibo-android-music-player
 Files that you need to turn your android phone into your own amiibo music player.


If you're an amiibo collector, you may have seen the amiibo music players like [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGOuCgbN1nc) that allow you to turn your minatures into your very own music player collection. And if you're like me, you may have wanted to make one yourself...if the barrier of soldering and coding the thing wasn't there to stop you.

To all those people who felt the same, I have created this: The android amiibo music player. It runs using the [Automate app](https://llamalab.com/automate/) on android, using the "Amiibo ID List", and "Amiibo Music Player" flows (also by me) that you can download in the app.

The files here include instructions on how to set your phone up with automate to get your amiibo working, as well as some preselected music files to play (using my own collection as a basis).

Have fun!

# Adding files to the repository

Have an amiibo but can't find a corresponding music and voice clip in this repository? Why not add your own!

Create a github account (if you don't have one), and you will be able to upload music and voice files for me to decide to add to the main repository. On the top bar (where it might say 'main', click the dropdown and select the "new-audio" branch

Click on the "amiibo_music" folder, and get ready to upload a music file to it. Choose a music file for your character; before uploading, be sure to title it with the song name, composer, and game origin in its properties (look at my music files as an example). Title your music clip with [character_name].mp3, and upload it. Do the same with your character's voice clip, if you want one, except to "amiibo_voices"

To alert me of your upload, create a pull request in the "new-audio" branch. In the description of the pull request, explain which song it is and where it is from. I will soon review the music, and merge the "new-audio" branch to the main.

Thanks for all your support!
